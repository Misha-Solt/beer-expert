## Idea

Our small team was tasked with creating a final project after completing a software development course. We had a lot of different ideas in different areas.... We wanted the final project to not only incorporate the tools we had learnt, but also be an additional motivation to learn new ones.
The theme of the app was also important. We wanted to find something that every German resident could understand. Beer looked like a fairly suitable example to us.
Based on [Deutscher Brauer Bund e.V.](https://brauer-bund.de/) data, there are more than 1,500 breweries in Germany that produce more than 7,000 beers.  It looks like there is a wide range of products to choose from and categorize😉
## Ordnung muss sein👍

> **Note**
> The authors of this resource are not promoting the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Any beer consumed during the project is considered to be for educational purposes😁  Residents of Germany under the age of 16 should avoid using this application and drinking beer.

## Design

The design of the app was created by the authors based on their personal preferences. The colour scheme is inspired by the colours of the German flag and possible beer colours. According to the authors, the design of the app should be as intuitive and simple as possible. The interface elements seem to layer on top of each other, creating a three-dimensional structure. The application is optimally adapted for use on any type of device without losing its functionality.  

## Instruments

This application uses:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Potential to grow

* Light/Dark theme mode
* German language version
* User Personal Page
* Collections and Favorites
* Moderating Administration Tools
* Geo-location interactive
* Mobile App versions
* And many more😉
